            <h2>From blackjack to building</h2>
            <p>I never set out to be a recruiter. It's just where I landed. It was 2009, and job offers had evaporated as fast as the economy did. Recruiting? Not exactly glamorous or why I went to college, but I'm glad I stumbled into it. <p> 

            </p> The way I found myself in this field? A series of serendipitous events. I heard about the job while playing blackjack in Vegas--yes, really. A flight to SF later, I'm sitting in an office wearing a tie. The managing partner? Shorts. The final interview? It happened in his car. His wife lost her keys, and we had to go pick them up. We either canceled the interview, or I went on that mission. I went. And I like to think rolling with the chaos got me that job. <p> 

            </p> But in reality, there was more risk in *not* hiring someone than in hiring someone like me--someone who had all sorts of jobs from a pharmacy to real estate investment to bartending to philanthropy and working for the Dean. It was a different time. The iphone sdk had just launched, people were getting rich off FarmVille, and TechCrunch was still Michael Arrington's blog. <p> 

            </p> I got the job and moved to SF over a weekend. New Year's day, actually. Commission-only, $36k draw. The firm was Riviera Partners. We were eight people. I spent every evening and weekend teaching myself about coding languages, frameworks, libraries--anything that could give me an edge. Our clients? Yammer, Zendesk, Groupon, Cloudera, Twitter, LinkedIn, Zynga. Not a bad roster. I learned to appreciate scale, business models, the difference between good and great. And soon, I got my first account: AppDirect. Then Cloudera, Zendesk, SumoLogic, AngelList...I am a great storyteller, and I listened to what people wanted out of their career. I was the top biller, and I kept it up. <p>

            </p> A few years went by. I needed to grow, and it wasn't here. I joined AppDirect full-time, hiring 500 people and growing with them to $100M run rate. Then came Stripe. I helped our founders build thier newest and most critical teams from 200-2000+. Recruiting wasn't enough anymore. <p>

            </p> I wanted to build. Sweat Equity Ventures was my transition into investing. Venture, I realized, isn't about finance. It's about people, talent, and networks. Knowing what great looks like. Helping founders accelerate. That's the edge. That's where I'm building+investing.
